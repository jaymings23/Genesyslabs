                         or florets, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk, which is usually light green.  
                        The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, which is a different but closely related cultivar

                        <p>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated 
                            using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one 
                            group and nutrition for the other; humans and many other animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food</p>

                    <h3>caviar</h3>
                    <p>Caviar is a food consisting of salt-cured roe of the family Acipenseridae. Caviar is considered a delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or spread.Traditionally, the term caviar refers only to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian Sea and Black (beluga, ossetra and sevruga caviars). The term caviar can also describe the roe of other species of sturgeon or other fish such as paddlefish, salmon, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish or carp
                        The roe can be "fresh" (non-pasteurized) or pasteurized, which reduces its culinary and economic value.</p>

                        <h3>mushroom</h3>
                        <p>The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word "mushroom" is 
                            most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills 
                            (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or
                             without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce 
                             microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.</p>
